This repository contains the scripts, data, and plots for the paper :


## Motivation

The inference of neural networks 

But no one is trying to use neural networks!

## Subproblem 1 

Using neural network to improve computation speed on maximum likelihood inference by using a trained NN instead of numerical optimization of likelihood for a given tree (see `notebook.Rmd`).
This seems to be a standalone paper to show prospect.

## Subproblem 2
Based on Zou2019:
- validate their results on quartet gene tree
- extend their work by simulating sequences under both CTMC (gene tree) and coalescent model (species tree)

# Folders/files

- `simulations-zou2019`: scripts to simulate data based on [Zou2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868908/). These simulations have 4 taxa (species)
- `plots`: script to generate the plot in Figure 2. in
