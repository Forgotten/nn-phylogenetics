This folder contains the implementations of the Neural Networks

- `equivariant_network` contains the python scripts with the neural network that respect the symmetries. 
- `Zou_et_al` contains our re-implementation in [Zou et al. Deep Residual Neural Networks Resolve Quartet Molecular Phylogenies. Mol. Biol. Evol., 37(5):1495â€“1507, May 2020.] in order to accept precomputed data.

The network require a json file to run. This files contains the values of the different parameters of the networks, including hyper-parameters.
